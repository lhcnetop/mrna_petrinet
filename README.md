# mrna_petrinet
Project using the PetriNets framework for simulation. This project is originally from https://github.com/lhcnetop/petri_net and is currently being maintained there. But to keep things organized, a refactor will separate the mRNA simulations and code and bring it to this repo, leaving only the main parts of petri net simulation and analysis there.
